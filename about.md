# A little about me

Hello, my name is Null. I’ve been making stuff with music/games for about 10 years now. This website exists as a hub of all my thoughts and projects. Layed out in a simple static site for your enjoyment.

## How i Got Here - From TF2 to Half-Life/Quake (And Everything in Between)

I’ve always been interested in games. Some of my fondest childhood memories are closely tied to whatever game i happened to be playing at the time. My favorite game was Max Payne 2 for a long time, then it fluctuated a lot. Team Fortress 2 i think was the first game to really grab my attention and it hasn’t let go since. I think nowadays my favorite games would have to be Half-Life 1/2, but it’s only those games because of how TF2 introduced me into mapping and modding, without that. I wouldn’t have learned any of the skills i know now. Probably wouldn’t be trying to make my own stuff at all in fact.

I still remember the moment where i first learned of Hammer (Source's level editor. The idea that i could make a map on the same level as the developers, and have it available for other people to play was mindblowing. Prior to it my only experiences with making anything of this sort was building custom “plots” in a multiplayer Minecraft server. It was a feature some servers had where each player would be assigned his own place in a grid and given full control over it to build stuff and then other people could fly over and visit. Even with that limited idea i still remember spending hours building shit and bringing people over to test it, though the system to do that was clumsy a lot of the time and the experience felt very isolating to a 13-year-old. You can see though how going from that to a full-on level editor was mindblowing to me at the time. There were only 2 problems though: For one, i was on a Mac at the time and Hammer was only supported in the windows version (Proton didn’t really exist back then as it does now). And two, I was a fucking dumbass at the time who barely knew how to use a computer, much less navigate my way around some complicated 3d tool. So i did go on to spend a few months learning and Unreal Engine 4 and that time is one i look back fondly on, mostly just thinking about how clueless i was back then is kinda funny to me now.

Eventually in 2015 i managed to buy a cheap prebuilt PC, i would then go on to spend the next 10 years of my life trying to make my own levels. First in TF2, then in Half-Life 2, Doom, Half-Life 1 and finally Quake. The journey revealed a lot about myself, it was difficult and arguably i think most people could learn a skill like this in much less time, but i digress.
