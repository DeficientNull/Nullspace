Hello, my name is Null. I've been making stuff with music/games for about 10 years now. This website exists as a hub of all my thoughts and projects. Layed out in a simple static site for your enjoyment.

## How i Got here

I've always been interested in games. Some of my fondest childhood memories are closely tied to whatever game i happened to be playing at the time. My favorite game was Max Payne 2 for a long time, then it fluctuated a lot. Team Fortress 2 i think was the first game to really grab my attention and it hasn't let go since. I think nowadays  my favorite games would have to be Half-Life 1/2, but it's only those games because of how tf2 introduced me into mapping and modding, without that. I wouldn't have learned any of the skills i know now. Probably wouldn't be trying to make my own stuff at all in fact.

I still remember the moment where i first learned of hammer. The idea that i could make a map on the same level as the developers, and have it available for other people to play was mindblowing. Prior to it my only experiences with making anything of this sort was building custom "plots" in a multiplayer minecraft server. It was a feature some servers had where each player would be assigned his own place in a grid and given full control over it to build stuff and then other people could fly over and visit. Even with that limited idea i still remember spending hours building shit and bringing people over to test it, though the system to do that was clumsy a lot of the time and the experience felt very isolating to a 13-year-old. You can see though how going from that to a full-on level editor was mindblowing to me at the time. There was only 2 problems though: For one, i was on a Mac at the time and hammer was only supported in the windows version (proton didn't really exist back then as it does now). And two, I was a fucking dumbass at the time who barely knew how to use a computer, much less navigate my way around some complicated 3d tool.

There was an alternative though. I thought surely while i wait i can learn a different game engine. So i ended up downloading Unreal 

## The Early Days 

And, see the problem with that is unreal did seem more inviting for a noob like me. But it's in reality one of the most bloated pieces of software one could ever set out to learn, especially when one knows nothing about how anything works.

My earliest achievement i remember being proud of was being able to build my own environment (using unreal's starter content assets) without a tutorial. It was simple, a small square room with a few tables and chairs, plaster floor and wooden walls. At this time i didn't really understand that even though i'd built my level with 3d tools very similar to what i thought hammer was, all the level geo was actually just meshes, and in modern 3d that's what you're "supposed" to use for 3d level design.

This period didn't last long though, cause it still took forever even with the builtin brushes. Eventually though i'd end up buying a PC in April 2015, finally i could get started learning hammer properly. I'd watched and rewatched UEAKCrash's TF2 Mapping Tutorials dozens of times at this point and i honestly couldn't wait to jump in.

Hammer was a joy to work with, after i'd learned the controls and gotten a good enough understanding of some of the level basics unique to source (I. e: Sealing the map, tool brushes, compiling etc). I thought i finally had just enough knowledge to build my first map, wanna see it? Have a look.

This is the only surviving screenshot i have of it. There was an even earlier King of the hill map but that's sadly been lost to time, it was shit though.

Of course, everyone's gotta start somewhere. This was around 2017-ish for me, around this time was when a certain sequence of events that greatly altered my life (mostly in a bad way), and that ended up affecting my progression in mapping in a very big way. My progress slowed to a crawl during this period.

## The Journey to Become a "Real" Game Developer

So anyway, i went to a game design college in 2019. It was an interesting experience, to say the least. In case you're wondering, this was not my decision. Because of prior events that had happened, i was more or less forced to sign up for a college course, didn't matter which. My parents were still in the idea that degrees are required to get a job anywhere but the problem is that i live in Brazil and, well it's not necessarily a country known for having great STEM courses, let alone game development ones. I struggled hard to find something that wasn't super expensive and had a somewhat decent curriculum (spoiler: they all suck).

So, how'd it go? Well i lasted for 4 months. 

Just a mix between being constantly aggravated by how uncomplicated most of the course is, since they basically just teach you Unity, and annoyed at having to share a medium sized house with six other people (The usual college dorm shit where if they bring a girl over you can hear them fucking from 3 rooms away). Just felt so depressed and hopeless that just got to the point where i started skipping classes, which is something i'd never done up to that point even though i breezed through most of my school years without too much effort. After a few weeks i realized "Alright i'm done".

At this point i wasn't just feeling dismayed about myself, i felt like the whole industry was a scam if this is supposedly the requirement to getting hired. Only a few years prior i'd realized that while hammer was a great program that was clearly very well-known by game developers during the mid-2000s, it was clearly not the standard anymore. Instead Level design as it was seen back then had been bisected into two separate disciplines, which forced you to specialize in either 3d modelling to work as an environment artist, or blockouts and design documents if you wanted to work as a designer. This felt very limiting since it didn't really allow for designers of yore to be able to execute on their vision without bringing in someone else to do all the actual level creation in 3D. It just seemed dumb, to want to get hired by an industry that forces it's workers into so much bullshit just to try and be more "efficient". So, i quit.

## Soul searching

So, the problem so far is looking back i could see how the whole university thing was a dead end. See the thing with me is having autism and ADHD means that i procrastinate a lot and whenever i learn something new i need to take my time with it to understand it. This is just simply incompatible with the way most universities expect you to do things in that they expect you to be able to rush through the actual learning of the skill so they can test you on it within six months. This gets even worse when you consider that in order to finish your curriculum in a reasonable time frame you have to take multiple classes per semester, to be fair, most of those classes are not that difficult, but the teachers in them still create enough busy work to the point that even those tasks become overwhelming the more of them there is. 

Still though, at that point in time i felt completely lost. Mentally i was still recovering from the burnout that had happened during the last few months of college. I decided that since i failed completely at doing the whole "being a real game developer" thing that instead i was going to go get a real job and/or learn a skill that could give me money on the short term.

This lasted for about 2 years until i in 2021 i finally decided to go back into it. I'd started enjoying a few singleplayer games during previous years and i found that when it cam to mapping, those games were a lot more interesting than tf2, mainly because it didn't require a full server of people to play them. Doom especially seemed like
