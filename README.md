# Nullspace

About a year ago i decided i wanted to build my own website, the result was the old defective null domain. To keep it short, the way i was doing stuff there had a lot of issues. So i decided to rewrite it.

## Markdown embedding with md-block

A pretty major feature now is that i get to write all my content in markdown, this is made possible by the wonderful md-block element. It features plenty all over the source and this is a great example of how to use it in this kind of project
