# We Live Again1 And this time better than ever.

So, it's been awhile. For those of you who don't know, i setup the first iteration of this website about a year ago under a separate domain (defective-null.siny-site). Long story short, building that taught me a lot but i was unhappy with how i did certain things. For one, i was writing everything in the site in html, this took forever and made editing things way harder to format than it should be.
